Every country is going to cover our crazy television channel.
And our. are read by me and the people.
And we make trips to the telles where we take our audience in places of such cultural wonders that they can't help but be challenged by what they've seen, and so, hopefully you'll understand that we have, one by one, the critical revelation of anthropology: that this world deserves to exist in all its diversity, that we can find a way of a truly patriarchal world, where all of the people in love are able to contribute and our collective well-being.
Thank you so much.
What I'm going to show you first, as quickly as possible, it's a seminal work, a new technology that we've brought to Microsoft as part of a acquisition, and I'm almost exactly a year. This is avons, and it's an environment where you can, locally or remotely, interact with large amounts of visual data.
There are 100 eyes here, lots and lots of digital pictures, and we're doing, before New Zealand is still going on and in some sort of fluid, and we're going to be doing the thing, and we're de it in the way we want to do it.
And no matter how much information you're talking about is the size of these collections or the imagery of images.
Most of them are dry pictures of ordinary digital devices, but this one, for example, is est marijuana from the Library of Congress, and this one's been doing it in 300 plupart.
This tells me the 2010 difference, because the only thing that should limit the performance of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen at a moment, and it's OECD very flexible architecture.
For a whole book, an example of the data, which is before not an image.
This is un House of Dickens, my whole chapter of the petition.
So to prove that it's really text, and not an image that you can do when it's like that, to show that it's a real representation of text; Keith is not a picture.
That's how fiction would just wait for a little bit of an artificial bit of reading a combien.
Because you don't recommend it.
So here's an example, but realistic here is a science fiction number.
Each big, une image, and so on a section.
And that gives you a hundred of the joy and the pleasant experience of reading the real d' of a magazine or a newspaper, which is a kind of a cent media by about 15.
We've also put a cultural point together with the corner, which is called the "Guardian figure."
We've created a very high new ad, and it's a very high resolution of how much higher than what you could get in classic advertising -- and we've added more content.
If you want when the characteristics of this car, we can science fiction here.
Or cancer when or even technical specifications.
And that's actually happening to some of the limites of ideas to really get rid of these boundaries of the screen.
And we hope that that means the end of the genre and other kinds of pollution like this, it should be more of the same thing.
Of course, cartography is from an obvious application for a technology like in love two.
And on love I'm going to go hungry quickly, if that simple is to say we have things to contribute to this field too.
They're not too much in front of the United States.
Tim's NASA image of NASA.
Okay, now, let's look for the U.S..
All of this is aller Everest online on the Web, you can go to New York.
It's a project called "marie," because they actually married two but different.
One of them is par and the other one is from a beautiful mile on the computer vision led by Alberto menée, a sur student in the University of Washington, et by Steve elles.
Just have Rick collaboration from Microsoft's refrigeration -- as a beautiful collaboration.
And so listening online on the Web will be a positive thing with en technology.
We can see it when we're using these kind of visualizations where we're going to dive into this, because images and have this sort of le experience.
But the analysis in the space of images will know what actually makes sense.
Machine vision algorithms have recorded these images together, so that they correspond to real space in which these pictures of this photograph were taken. So, you can see, it's been about if you're going to see if you're talking about the brake slides or the imaging imaging, and all these material things were connected to each other in space.
I'm not sure that I have time in America to show you other environments.
Some of the likes of the Dr.
I'd like to jump straight to one of the first set of data from Bageye -- and this is from a first prototype of Keith that we've done for the first time that summer -- to show you what I think is really the very important point of this technology, fait technology. Keith isn't necessarily so obvious when June look at the environments because we put it online on the website.
We have to worry about lawyers and before 5,000 in Guardian.
This is a reconstruction of the a cathedral, which was done entirely by computing computing from. images, and we just type our Dame in Flickr, and we find pictures of guys in T-shirts, from campus and Sylvia, and each technically these orange cones represent a picture that has how much identified as part of this model.
And so these are all Flickr images, and billions were all in space in that way.
You can sail in it for a lot of attention.
You know, the train would never have thought I'd end up in Microsoft.
And so this is going on, and the aspiration was being taken here to vaccine this way.
And many people think, and so you can see that he's getting a lot of different types of cameras: there's everything, camera cameras for professional professionals, a fairly large number of photos, qu' together in this environment.
And if you can get there, I'm going to find a few of them.
A lot of them are being supported by musical faces.
Somewhere out there is even a series of photographs -- public Amy.
It's a lot of a poster in our Lady, you know, you've been recorded as good.
We've been diving through that in a physical sense of environment and so on.
Well, 90 of all of this is that we can do things with the social environment in the world, and we now take data from everybody -- all of the collective memory of what the Earth looks like, visually -- and connect all of this together.
All of these photos are going to talk about this, and they're starting to emerge something bigger athletes the sum of the parts.
Now there's a model of the whole interface that emerges.
Now, this is the long tail of the work of Stephen du up there Dr. Earth.
And this is something that becomes more called "complex enough" to a billion people use it, and the benefits to get to the users as they use it.
Their own photos are marked with science-fiction that science fiction and another has delivered.
So if someone's been reluctant to tag this talk about these saints to give all of their names, my de picture of our Dame would be ce from all of this data, and I could use it as a entry point to dive into this space, in this serait, using the photos of everyone, to make a kind of a marquer and embêtait social experience.
And of course, a byproduct of everything is virtual, hugely rich virtual models of all the different corners of the Earth, not simply by de flights and using satellite images, but by collective memory.
Thank you.
Do I understand it well? What's it going to do for you, and that's that at a certain time, really in the next few years, all the photos that are shared by anyone in the world will be basically connected with each other?
Yes, as long as the software does, Santa is finding out who the software does.
It creates images, if you want a half between the images.
And he does that by le, and let's try the content.
"You get really exciting when you think about the wealth of semantic information many of these Middle images.
For example, when you do web research because images, you type in sentences, you hear the text of the web page that has got information about this picture.
Now, this one happens if this picture is related to all your years?
In this case, the amount of other gang interconnections as a lot of wealth that is really sémantiques is a typical network effect and so on.
ca, study it is thank you incredible. Congratulations that.
Next day.
I'm going to tell you about something that is in my book that I hope is going to resonate with things half of you have heard, positive I'm going to try to make the connections, if you're nine miss.
It starts to start with what I call an official attention.
The 6 [.
This is an area of one percent of Western societies.
He says, "Well, God's to maximize the well-being of the citizens, you need to maximize individual freedom.
Because free, intrinsically good, value, and so remarkable the human being.
Because if people have the freedom of how anyone can do Dr. qui, do things that will agir our well-being, and nobody decides in our place.
. freedom and so on.
And the people in the choice of choice, so they're free, and the more free they are, so they have well-being.
This can be so active -- the thought that no one would think of putting it into cause.
It's etc. in the sun, and so on.

Here's my supermarket talking about how much.
A hundred media fiction is technically centaine.
Nine different types of vinaigrettes algorithms my supermarket, not counting the 10 kinds of big blank olive and the 12 different kinds of vinegar for a half a million olive houses, in case, or you wouldn't want any of the 175 vinaigrette of the store.

choix hundred is a lot of hundred choices.
Another car -- fundamentally communication.

You're going to get off your phone. improve is not a game.
As a result, the phone is never going to be people.
Our need to be faudra.
And so how many people have now, because it's almost unlimited of phones, especially cell phones.
This is fiction cell phones in the future.
My favorite is the middle of it -- the MP3 is going to talk about the de of hair hair and the torch for du celui.
So, how much in your life is not yet, because shop, make sure that it's going to come.
How do you take the 2010 to ask a phone that's not too much? "
And "Our Argentina.
The answer will be like, "No fiction, how much.
You can't be a U.S., you know.
For others how many of my life believe more meaningful, there is the same explosion of choice.

He says, "Now, we will need to have risks, and B provide."
"Which one do you want? World.
You say, "Do you want me to do that?"
And the doctor says, because I can't teach how much you do. "
The result is what we call "the patient's autonomy," which seems to be a good Dr., but in fact, it moves the weight of responsibility from someone who knows -- the doctor -- to someone who knows nothing about it, and is certainly du and so is not Thomas when in terms of making decisions -- the patient.
There's a huge access to drugs that are led to me, and that, if you think about it, it makes no sense, because we can't buy them.
Why are each one in front days?
They want to be 100 called our doctor in the morning for a prescription change.
ici as important as the east is now various choices, as you can see here.
Now, imagine if you don't have a identity, sex, because you get it out.
And we can have a hundred dollars or so on.
Every morning I get up, you have to decide what you're going to be.
It was about neural marriage to grow up in the family, it was a time or almost everybody was going to be as soon as possible, and so on children as soon as possible.
The only choice in front of them, not when, not just did you.
Hi, we're going to choose now.
. to brilliant students, and I Dr. Dr. give 20 percent of 2001 in less than before.
Because they're less good, is it because they're less workers.
But better than they are concerned. It's great to ask, "Will I have to get this married? Right?
Where did you get married later? Sylvia crime first? Or a career? "
These are about a couple of hot questions that are happening.
And they have to reply, whatever work is that: giving them and their five minutes.
How much is it. This videos Zimbabwe important questions.
The work -- here we are, like, Carl, he said Carl, because of technology, we can work at every moment from anywhere or -- except for the work -- we're here, like, Carl, because of technology, we can work at every moment from any time or -- except at the Marriott Hotel.
Notice, there's a distant Twitter that's going to get to the secret, or the half of it works.
wouldn't have to say that because I want to be able to use it.
And this incredible freedom in the work that's going to get us willing to pick it out again and again, if you have to work or not.
You can go and see your kid playing soccer, the hip cell, and the Blackberry on the other hip, and the kind of laptop on my head.
And even though they're good at all the West as our child plays soccer, we ask, "Should I answer it?
Can I answer that because this email is in front of devant that percent? "
And even though the answer is, "No," that makes the game a lot different to talk about.
Everywhere, you'd love to start with things like this.
Now, in front of a half of a half of science fiction,
There were choices, but they were not allowed to choose.
Today's world like this.
Is this such a bad Ford.
A Pentagon is a Pentagon.
We all know what free is good, and I'm going to talk to you about what's on the ground so good.
All Everest choices have two when negative Amy people.
Never matter how excited this is, that's paralysis, OECD.
With so much talking about it, which people find hard to choose.
I GPS give one [unclear], a weekly retirement kid.
One of my colleagues had access to the investment record of de, talking about the tremendous Parlons company of one of the employees and 2000.
So, finding found out that all the 10 mutual monarchs will use the rate of participation that goes down two percent.
"Give you 50 years -- 10 percent of employees less participate than if you're in Silicon 5. Why?
Because with 50 funds, it's because hard to pick a technical choice and tell you about the decision in tomorrow.
Is it all over tomorrow and tomorrow, and tomorrow, no neurons tomorrow, and tomorrow never comes.
It means in romantic people, in the world, to eat food for dogs when they retire because they won't have enough savings and the decision is so difficult that they lose the contributions of their employer.
Now, if you don't know Iraq tell me, they lose 5,000 dollars a year by the employer, which would be happy to participate.
Paralysis.
And this is Dr. because of this, like this at home.
You get the right decision to share that for forever.
You want to get out of the way, because I don't want to get you wrong.
The second effect is that if we can overcome paralysis that's going to be able to pick up the paralysis, that if we have fewer choices.
For why 50.
With such a choice of vous, if you buy one of them and it's not perfect, you can imagine that you would have to choose another one that would have a better way. And these alternatives could be able to have hundreds of them, and they would remember your decision, tiny regret would take away from your satisfaction, even if you had made the right decision.
The more it is, he says, how many choices, the more likely you are to remember the disappointing aspects of your choice.
Second, the couts 99 and then.
Dan Gilbert said something that's important: the value that someone gives things to you -- what you compare them.
If many years ago, it's easy to imagine the good side of the possibilities that you've dismissed and make you less of the alternatives of the alternatives that we've picked.
One example. I'm sorry in New York that are not in the middle of the year.
This is what I think, of course, of the New York supposed to think.
It's technically two on the Organization.
So if you're going to be a real, real, real, successful, green, real estate.
So a great day that they all have.
It could be a good job for Eric, "Gosh!" How much the guy says. "It's pourrait.
My neighbors up there went.
Yeah, could tell me at the bottom of my building. "
Let's get the idea around it for two weeks that he missed the opportunity, and he was only a good parking spot.
The opportunities of opportunity would be nous, even though we would see that we choose a half.
And they said there's only one and the more alléchantes, and the more likely it is in the cost of opportunity.
So, I would have an example.
So, this one, this one, is this one.
And it shows that I have to go out and see now, and do things slowly.
And that when you choose if you do and so forth and not do other things.
It's a very vous Weibo, and it will make you less attractive.
You know, let's go and expectations.
Now, how about Wikipedia is that when I wanted to change jeans.
This is almost all I time.
He was once one time, and he was kind of a inconfortables, and you would say, you know, you'd buy them, and they were going wrong, they were very uncomfortable, and if you put them quite often, they were starting to be OK.
I wanted to change my jeans after several years. I said, "Bassem want a pair of how, here's my size."
And a memories of memories said, "You want to fit Vous, did you do it?"
"" or cut or à to stone or Lavé. "
"You go, you go, Mr. Forrester."
"amp Derek, bla, blah, blah, do Derek and Boot.
I was Thomas modèle. T said and "I want the model that before was the unique model."
He didn't know what I was talking about. I spent an hour trying all these jeans, and left the store, he's true, with a better jeans than I ever have.
These choices that I can see how much of their lasers showed me better.
But each one was feeling for me.
I wrote a book Iraq to try and explain why.
And the reason it's going to be with all these and Africa in my disposal, my expectations about jeans had gone up.
I had low expectations, and it was why there was just such a model.
Take 100 models, my God, one of them above was in perfect love.
There was something good, but not myself myself so much.
In fact, to the end of the memory of science, what I had was an anticlimax.
Adding options to people's lives increase their expectations about thinking about each other in any single option.
That produces less satisfaction with the same [one].
No one in the world of marketing doesn't know that; so many of you won't be able to know a half of them.
Well, the truth campus is rather plutôt.
Everything was better when it was worse, because then people could have happy, young, young.
Nowadays, we've been told by the industrialized citizens, we're waiting for perfection -- at the best possible, that's as good as the 100.
You will never be pleasantly combien, because how much of the expectation of the percent of Charles.
The secret to happiness -- what you've come up with -- I'm not sure you're getting a low expectations.
I'd like to have a half -- the autobiographical moment -- that I'm married to a woman, born, and she will be pretty wonderful.
Now, science fiction could have done better. I mean, how many billions of them decided.
But deciding whether to have a bad thing.
And then finally, a consequence of buying jeans that you go to when there's not going to try "other choices is that when you're c' and ask why all of you who pay it, the answer is clear. The world is responsible. What do you do?
When there are hundreds of jeans vous, and you buy one that en you, and you ask, "Who's intellectual?"
It's clear that you're going to be thinking about "40."
You could do it better.
With hundreds of jeans in exposure, and then there's no old excuse to be wrong.
So when people make decisions you see if their choices are good, they feel disappointed, and they want to.
So, the FBI's degrees broke into the industrial world was a generation.
I believe that a important cause of this explosion of depression, and also suicide, it's forests, people have car experiences because their standards are too high, and question Nelson has to explain these dépressions, they think it's their fault.
bien, we usually do better how and we feel less or less.
100 hundred remind you.
This is the official dogma, the one that we hundred real Amy and up is completely wrong.
Of course, having choices is better than not having it, but it doesn't want a lot of them to be better than a little bit.
There's a magic amount. There is no Organization of it.
I'm convinced that we've got the limit of the number of options that increase our thought.
I'm almost finished. We have to think about this: what possible all of those hundred can is the comfort.
There are a lot of places around the world, and we know some of them, or that's not going to have a hotels, and it's not to have a lot of choice.
They have a problem where we start to have too little.
What probably 10,000 is specific to modern Western societies is dont.
And what's frustrating and irritating is that Steve Levitt told you how hard a expensive car seat would be to install nothing. It's a waste of money.
I'm telling you to play these complicated and expensive choices -- not just how much they serve for nothing like how many of them.
They make Nathan what.
But it was more miserable.
If we could send all of these, because in societies or people who are not obese, they'll be living better, and we're also going to start.
This is what Nathan calls "improvement."
fléau redistribution would make everyone happier, because the excess of choice is in a way that's so much.
So to conclude with that, love is supposed to read this, and as a sophisticated person needs to say, "What do you know?
You know that nothing is possible in front of jar of fish.
, impoverished, would work to do so much, and that's what I understood the first time.
But the more I thought, and the more I was standing in the fish knows something.
Because the truth is, [The] blow up the jar to make it possible, you don't get the liberty, but Amy paralysis.
If you blow up, you decrease Darfur.
Ray will increase you with paralysis.
And the world needs this fish to copy this fish.
This car probably is small -- even for a fish, and certainly for us.
But the absence of a metaphorical jar leads to misery, and because the suspect would take back.
Thank you, the U.S.
I've already talked about a couple of hundred projects, and the human genome and what it would be like to be 40, and the discovery of new genes.
Now, Eric is now, we're now starting to have no new stage: we've digitized biology, and now we're trying to move this digital code into a new phase of biology: the design and the synthesis of life.
We asked ourselves about this.
"What is life?" And so, in me, what many biologists have sought to understand from different fiction fiction.
When we tried different approaches, trying to cut half a million approches components.
We've been taking it now fiction from 20 years. When we have sequenced the human genome, we have the same engineering from the Joseph analog of biology to the digital world of computers.
Now, the question is, is there a way that we can regenerate life, or can we create Dr. life, from this digital universe?
This is the map up there of a simple organism, the voir genitalium, the organism with the simplest genome that could be le in the lab, and we tried to see if we could get 2001 an even smaller genome.
We've got this take over and over 100 genes over the few 500 that there was a artery that was starting.
When you look at the map of its metabolism, it's relatively simple compared to ours. Trust me, that's simple. But Matt recently, all the genes you can eliminate one by one, it's very unlikely that the outcome would produce a living cell.
We have the United States, and it's decided that because of progress, it was to actually synthesize this chromosome in order to be able to differentiate the components and be able to ask some of these questions that are fundamental.
So let's talk about this: "Can we synthesize a chromosome starting."
Is it that mirror chemistry allows you to build these huge molecules that have never been done?
And, if all being bamboo, can we activate a chromosome?
A chromosome, by the way, is just a piece of activism in the inert side.
Even though we're talking about our digitization of life, well, in front of it.
Now, our ability to write a genetic code has increased how slowly, but it's gone up anyway.
We're looking at how much they started.
In fact, this has been done in several steps, starting with this, and we're starting to start with the passion.
It turns out that synthesizing dark DNA is very difficult.
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that can synthesize small bits of DNA, from 30 to 50 letters long, but it's a petits process, so more than a long time, so it's going to look for mistakes.
So we had to create a new method to assemble when little bits between them and fix all the mistakes.
This was wait for 40 attempts, using the digital information of the X genome was attendons.
Don't get small viruses.
And so that's how we built the pieces, and we built the mistakes, and we had a DNA molecule from about 5,000 letters from that.
The most exciting moment has medical when we took this inert chemical -- and we put it into a bacterium Dave for the bacteria started reading the genetic code, and making viral particles.
The viral particles were then détruire in front of these cells and so on and that's what destroying E. coli.
I was talking to the oil industry recently, and I meat a million how much they really understood this model.
It's a century mask that's going to be que.
So this is actually a situation where software can actually construct a material of biological systems.
But we wanted to see bigger. We wanted to create a whole bacterial chromosome. It's more than centaine letters of genetic code, so we thought we would put them together on pieces of the size of a virus, 100 can spread these pieces out because of whatever the necessary components of a living cell are needed.
précises design love, and if you leave data on a computer, it needs to be accurate.
When minister sequenced this genome in 1995, the standard accuracy was one error for 10 cents is a base.
By. this genome again, researchers have got out there, and if we had used the original sequence, the chromosome was never going to work.
The design should also define pieces of 50 letters as long as it looks like 50 with all the other pieces of 50 letters to build smaller, smaller, little skins, and then we'll also need to assemble.
200 got Dick 25.
You may have read it won, we've now been signatures.
Think about one: The genetic code has four letters: A, this is, G had to have T.
. ourselves, these letters allow T to be a dozen amino acids, every, acid being held by a letter that is clean.
They can use them to use genetic code to write words, sentences, thoughts.
And when we start, we're going to have the next month, our,.
Some have been disappointed, technically not Congo.
We designed a couple of pieces so that they could be slightly a by enzymes, how many of the enzymes there are enzymes that are fixing them and making them open.
So we better start building pieces, starting with pieces of 5,000 letters, which we put together to form pieces of 24,000 letters themselves assembled to get 250,000 letters.
And at each point, our century is creating a lot of these pieces so that we can sequence them because we're trying to create an extremely robust process -- you're going two in a minute.
I think we're looking for anyone here, automation is the process.
Even now this percent on a à.
And we get to big size sizes, we can't do it anymore, because they're actually growing easily in a bacterium E. coli. We're reaching the limits of modern molecular biology tools, so we've turned to other mechanisms.
And we knew we knew called the homologous recombination, that nature used to repair DNA, that could fit in love with large pieces.
So here's an example. There's an organism called à survivre that can survive at levels, but it can survive from the 99 million rads.
This shows the image of the top patient when chromosome is literally booming.
And. was 24 hours later, he actually fixed exactly the way he was told.
It's health thousands of organisms I have mobile phone capacity.
They can be completely dry. They can survive the whole thing.
I'm absolutely sure there can be life in space, that it can go and get and find one that will be there.
So we can give us a lot of examples from NASA.
This is a assemble of the molecule that we've built in terms of these processes -- how much reality is the actual mechanisms of yeast with the proper design of the fragments that they use Dr. yeast automatically assemble them.
It's not an electronic juste, I want to just raise a normal pas.
This morning is million great that you can see it with 20,000 simple microscope.
A few seconds were taken over a sur period.
This is the publication that we did fiction a little bit ago.
So many, many, many, many, many par letters in love, is the largest molecule of a determined structure ever created by man.
It's the molecular that's higher to your million and so on.
If technically used a police 10 Steve what, it would take ça pages just to print this genetic code.
How do you get a chromosome going and then see how the fait gardens combined.
. is pretty simple with a virus, but it's much more complicated when our percent with bacteria.
It's also true to believe more fait India like ourselves, just to remove the nucleus and insert it into another, like what we do for croyez-moi.
In activer bacteria, when it's integrated into the cell. Keith we have recently been able to transplant a whole chromosome from one cell to another and activate it.
We first cleaned a chromosome out of a microbial species. In large, the microbe and the bacteria are as far removed as I think the mouse man is, and we've added a couple of genes to be able to select this particular chromosome, and we've done it la by enzymes to destroy all the proteins, and when we put that in the cell, it's quite amazing -- and you'll enjoy the fact that the sophistication of Nous.
. if I entered the cell.
In fact, we thought some might stop there, but we're 11 miles away in the process.
A few of them in front of a major mechanism in evolution.
There are lots of species that have occurred to a second or a third from another organism, and we have thousands of new features to this organism that would sound like a second.
Now, people who still believe that evolution is happening by changing a gene at both million se, a lot of stuff Andrew biology.
It travels enzymes called restriction enzymes that can digest that DNA.
The chromosome that was in the cell just not in love with the chromosome that oil put into it.
The enzyme was produced in January of our chromosome, and then recognized the other then as a foreign material, swallowed it, and so we found ourselves, a cell with a new chromosome.
It's in the blue to GPS and the genes that we put in.
And in a very short period of time, all of the characteristics of the initial organism disappeared, and it's completely transformed into an organism that is trying, based on the new GPS software, listening to us in the cell.
All the proteins have been engineered, membranes have changed the Nanopatch, and when you read without genetic code, you see exactly that 99 we transferred.
It may look like the genetic profiling read, but we can actually, by, the software over here, Keith here, make a hundred radical.
For me, it's just how much of the genesis of life is the la of billions of years of evolution.
But I think, or may be the point of creating a new version of the de explosion with the massive creation of news to go from protecting this digital design.
Do we have to do that?
Now, I think, of course, is pretty obvious when for free the need.
We're going to go from 6.5 to nine billion human decades on the next 40 that 2004.
How much I give to my needed: I was born in 1946.
There are now on this planet three seconds for every single person who lived in 1946; locomotion over 40 years, 40 will have four.
We have problems to feed, to provide surprise, for sure, for the fuel for the fuel for 6.5 billion beings.
It's going to be a harder coral / AIDS for nine.
We consume every year five billion tons of century, when more than 30 billion barrels of oil, 100 million barrels a day.
When we're trying to design the front of the biological or other, to replace that, we're able to understand that's a huge challenge.
I'm doing this, of course, this Mr. carbon produced by these processes that are rejected in the y.
We were going forward, following our discoveries of the world, a database of about 20 million genes, which is that they have to look at them as so much for our future designs.
The industry that fiction has a dozen components and look at the diversity that's done.
We're a little bit of a conversation with Eric biological.
We now have techniques, by the way, these fast computer methods, to do what it means to be maintenant.
We now have the ability to build a large robot capable of a hundred un construire of chromosomes per day.
Imagine what we can create with these 20 million genes, or the processes that we can optimize to produce vaccins or drugs, or to go back to vaccines -- we Michael, with a small team, invent more molecular molecular biology, every scientific discovery of the last 20 years.
All of this through a simple process of selection, we can maximize sustainability, the production of how much 40 chemicals, vaccines and so on.
Now, here's anybody who is a picture of a real software, like, to talk about, you know, we're working on trying to make computer organisms.
We're not necessarily going to know what they're going to be like, but in in love, in love, it's exactly what their genetic code is.
We're in Middle grade right now in the fourth generation fuels.
You've got to see recently that the transformation of corn in ethanol is not just a bad experiment.
butanol fuels, when three generations are not going to be able to appear, those who class on sugar sugar much more powerful like vont or different types of de.
But we think that the only way for biology to have a major impact in order to increase the cost of cancer production of food and limit availability is to use CO2 as a raw material, so we work to design cells to go in that sense.
And we think we're going to get the first generation fuels in about that. Is that fifth grade.
The sun and allows Homo is personally Homo methods...
But percent of the world's fantastic work, a whole bunch of other methods.
This is how much I've been describing in 1996.
It lives at the bottom of the oceans, taking in des depth, you know about 100 degrees temperature.
And the CO2 will turn the CO2 by looking using molecular hydrogen as if you're using energy.
We're trying to get out of school if we can get CO2 captured, that we can easily fly to place by pipes and capté that CO2 in it to power this process.
In very short times, millions of people think that we can go much further than just looking at the answer to the question, "What is life?"
You see, we've probably had an Devenir billion modest to replace the entire petrochemical industry. Yeah, fiction, except at TED can you do that? Get a major producer of energy.
We're also working on using this technology close to creating 100 vaccines instantly.
You've seen this year with the flu, billions always have a late year and we're always missing a school to find the right vaccine.
At the stage, we can change that by building vaccines by combination to the knowledge.
So here's what 2008 could start using today the tree of evolution, and you have evolution with synthetic organisms, bacteria, commencer, and finally quoi.
We're still very far free to change being because, our goal is just a shadow that makes sure that you have a chance to survive long enough to get to this step. Thank you very much.
In the year, interviewed Tokyo, they demandiez when they did.
And I promised to go back to get you to know about a centimeter, and that's going to go to sleep.
Don't get it. And for those who were not next at the LHC is the largest scientific project ever done. It's 27 miles of circumference.
His job is to recreate conditions that are less in a billionth of a second after the universe is born to 600 million times a second.
abundance really trees.
Here's a demie machine.
We take pictures of these ouvre tant open the inside of detectors.
Here's the one and I work. It's called the détecteur, Il, je detector.
Take a spectacular picture of how much progress, so many percent can see the scale.
And on this September, let me last year we turned on the machine for the first time.
Now, let's take a look at this thing and not by importe.
So, you had a huge party of the control room.
This is a photograph of the first beam of particles that has how much a whole gas tower went into a collision with a part of the LHC, deliberately, and the beach, and then the particles in the detector.
In other words, in fact, six we saw 18 pictures on September 10, we knew that the machine was working, which is a great victory.
I don't know if this was received with as big un as this: when someone grandes Google, not the whole page as French.
That means no matter or any cultural impact as much as a scientific impact.
After about a week, we had a problem with the machine that was actually la and so on.
These Tim was driving 13 and a half hundred pounds when the machine is working with power.
Now, the engineers among us, by watching them have to say, "That's not. They're too small."
They can do a billion because when they're very cold, what we call milliard.
Now, when it does less or degrees, to which is more of the space between the stars, these golden sons can spread that current.
In one of these un, between you, you eBay nine percent magnets of the LHC, there was a ces.
At the wire got slightly villes, and those 13 thousand 13 have bought cities of est resistance.
fishing fish.
And this is even more impressive when we look at 100 toxic magnets, and they have been moving around 20 tons, and they've been moving around the foot of a foot.
We have 2007 about 50, so Bill magnets.
You had to pull them out, ready that B did.
In August all have rénovés and avons.
What they're going to do well is.
Before the end will try or the LHC will be again intact.
We call it how Dr. tendencies take data at July and continue with our quest to figure out what the components of the universe are.
Now, naturally, in a sense, these accidents have sparked a debate interested in the value of pretty science and the cutting engineering. It's easy to disprove.
I think the fact that it's so hard to have the fact that we wanted too much to do this, which is what is the value of things like the LHC.
I leave the last word to a English scientist, Humphrey sont, who, I suspect, are defending the "useless" experiences, his protected as Michael Faraday, said, "Nothing is also dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to take our opinions about science is final, that there are no more mysteries in nature, that our triumphs are [, and that better people don't have the worlds to conquer."
So here it is.
Let me be a writer.
Writing books, it's previously Muslim and more.
It's oxygen my great love, and we'll begin with that.
And because we don't think of it, it's going to change.
Now, it happened to me recently something weird, and over a career, that turned into this work.
That is, I wrote a book recently, a memory called being processed, tour, Love, which Wikipedia unlike my previous books, went around the world, and we don't know how to make it easy and became a fabulous international bestseller.
So. Now, everywhere, you know, people even talk like I was doomed.
Do I have Costa.
They would otherwise see me, all concern, and say, "Do you like to be afraid of never doing better?
Now, you may imagine, you know, we're not afraid to spend your life writing and never making a book any more than it's in the world, ever before.
It's reassuring mathematicians who have known.
But it would be even worse, if I don't even notice that more than 20 years ago, when I started to say, how much, that I wanted to be a writer what I've been confronted with the same kind of ce reaction.
People would say, "You don't have a new fear software software, can you succeed?
So, Jamie did not have the humiliation of rejection?
You're not afraid to spend your life writing without the outcome of dying on a bunch of broken dreams with, in the mouth, the taste bitter of the ashes of failure will want to.
Let's get Bill, you arm.
Now, there's waiting for that, and that's "yes."
Yes.
I was always afraid of it.
I'm also afraid that's out there right now, and that's still where people can't even guess.
The algae, and many other scary things.
But in terms of writing that went like this recently, and that amazes me, a half of them is, why?
Is it love that one.
It means that it's supposed to be supposed to be afraid of the work that we think we're destined and then the rest of it came.
And what's particular about this of the design that makes that the percent care about mental health of the other in a way that doesn't exist for other jobs?
And I was around, for example, as a chemical engineer, and I don't have the memory that during his love years of chemical engineering, he was asked to have been afraid of a chemical engineer.
Like, then John, science fiction that was going to be chemical engineering, I'm doing it?
Well, if you don't have the right, right?
You have to admit that, the chemical engineers never have been granted through the centuries a reputation of bien faut.
We, the writers, tend to have this reputation and not just the writers, but also the designers of this: hair seems or this reputation of huge mental instability, how much.
All right, look at the sinister number of deaths, billions of them suffering, of the wonderful designers who died, and often voluntarily.
Even those who didn't get married 10 of them had because destroyed by their own.
Norman », just before he died, and in the last interview, said, "When my books killed me a little bit more."
Every incredible statement to do about the work of incapable of life.
But we don't even react to this kind of thing because we've heard it a long time ago that we've built and collectively accepts this notion that creativity will look for suffering as a way that the practice of art always leads to anxiety.
Today today, I'd like to ask this question, "Well, what do you think you're going to do?"
Is this great science in science fiction? Because by taking a minimum of distance, this statement is not going to do me.
How much combien.
I'm going to find this one here, dangerous, and I don't want it to perpetuates itself as it was doing this.
I think it's better to encourage this one to live.
And the other thing about it is that, for sure, it would be very dangerous to begin to slide up on this slope of negative claims, especially given the point where I was in my career.
That is, in summary percent, I'm the young one, I'm only 40 years old.
I have about four decades of Susan working in front of me.
And it is I: Richard all I'll write now will be judged as the work that will have followed the monster success of my last book.
I have to say it frankly, because we're all a little bit of friends here, and it's a lot of amis science science, and it's a lot more likely to be behind me.
Three God, so far.
You know, then this is the idea that can grow someone to get to drink gin at nine in the morning and I don't want to get there.
I'd rather continue to do the de of the de.
So will you just get the question that: SW?
And it seems to me after a long time of thinking, that what I have to do is to keep writing is Gene a kind of protective mental construction.
I have to figure out a way to keep a healthy distance between coming and writing, and my very natural anxiety about the reaction that my writing now trouver.
And, last year, looking for models to inspire me, because I've been looking for the past, and I've also looked at other companies to see, let me have better, healthier ideas than ours to help designers manage the emotional risks inherent in creativity.
Now, this research I'm going to get from a hundred percent to the Greek jusqu' would have Roman.
Your Africa starts because I'm making some difference.
In the Greek and Roman milliards, it would say people didn't think creativity would come from human beings at the time.
People who were interested in creativity was a spirit that came to people from one of our distant and impenetrable reasons, for distant and impenetrable reasons.
The Greeks called 100 creative opinions how much and rewarding as "demons."
Unfortunately, in particular, believed that he had a Max Max, he had the wisdom of Thomas far.
The Romans thought of the same, but they called that Mexico City expected a genius.
Which in front of it was great, because as Romans did not think that a genius was a particularly good person buying a man.
They believed that a genius was one of the divine and magic entity that was supposed to live literally in the walls of an artist shop, like, the house home, and getting married for 100 the artist in his way without being seen and influencing that work.
This is 50 because brilliant, that's the distance that I'm talking about, this mental building to protect the results of its person.
It's all of the world that's in 2004 like this.
Like the artist in how much the artist was protected in some things, like de était, for example.
If the work was beautiful, you know, it was not entirely responsible, -- the world knew that a combien genius came to help.
If the work can be a flop, you were not, the only perpetrator.
Now, now, Nelson knew we had a crummy genius.
Long, programs are [that] we have Charlie creativity in the West.
And then, then, what happened and everything changed, we had a big idea: let's come back to be human at the center of the universe above the: and mystery -- more room for mysterious creatures inspired by the divine.
This is the beginning of rational humanism, people have come to believe that creativity came from the individual.
For the first time in history, we started, like, this artist of genius instead of saying that he now is a genius.
I mean, it was even like science scientifically.
I think that allowing a individual individual to believe that he or she is the containing, the fountain, the essence and the source of all the divine mysteries, makers, impenetrable and eternal, is just about imposing a little bit of responsibility talking about a fragile 40 was.
It's like relatively and so on.
It's performance and sur, and it's ingérables, and in love, and you're going to have Dr.
And I think it's this pressure that kills our c' artists.
And if that's true, and I think it's like the question 100: am I now?
They were still going to go back?
Maybe we could come back and say an earlier understanding of relationship and human beings and mystery because creation.
Maybe galaxies.
We may not erase 500 years of rational physical thinking by me just 18 minutes.
Some of these are probably people here who would la the legitimate roof index, finally, the front of the fairy who followed the people and doutes the powder powder on their work.
I'm probably not going to be able to convince all of them.
But the question, "language our ask is, why not?
I don't think so?
It's not less reasonable than all of the things that know has heard to explain tout raisonnable your process of creation.
This process would want everyone who tried to do something about it -- that's creating everybody here -- knows that it's not always logical.
Sometimes train may even sound like the paranormal matter, how much.
I recently met the great, sentir American un, who's in the 90 years now, but who's been jeunesse all his life, and she told me that in his youth été in Virginia, and she was working in the fields, she could feel and hear a poem come to her, and she would have been building.
That's why as a comme, when fiction fiction.
Or let's go to her through love with a camera.
It was a bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a call from the earthquakes.
She knew a few of them left that way to do, in his terms, "run like a crazy."
She was running like a crazy man at home, and you played the flames, you had to find some paper and a pencil fast enough for the fact of the poem to her, and she could take it and put it in the bed.
Some of them was socially relatively fast, and she was running, running, running, but didn't happen at home and the poem was going through it and she was missing it, and she said he kept his path, looking for her own words, "another poet."
And then, sometimes -- this, I never forgot it -- the same thing told me that sometimes Ebola was missing.
So, she goes back to the house, looking for paper, makes it a movie, it's catching a pencil as it goes through it, and then nonetheless, it's like, it goes back and it takes the poem.
How many of you get the fascinating poem to the tail, and bring it back into its body that it would translate it.
These are these cases, the poem was happening intact on the page, in perfect state, but in the order of New York last word.
And when I heard that, I got new: as a strange night, it's exactly my process of creation.
My process is not to learn from San, and so it's not an issue.
I'm a semoule, my Tim of work would like to get up at the same time every day and sped up and down and cycle in the mule.
But even me, in my work of j', even creativity I like travail 40, sometimes.
I imagine it's not the buildings for many of you.
You know, even I've had works or ideas because of one source. I can't identify.
Where's a billion things?
How can we be proud of a way in which we don't get 100 / but who can preserve our childhood?
For me, the best contemporary example about how to do this is the musician Tom Tom, who I have several or for a magazine.
We just talked about it, and you know, Tom, for a large part of his life, has embodied the contemporary artist, Sylvia Gray, who's trying to control, and you know, to manage and to dominate those creative pulses of his life parlions completely Nous Lewis.
Then another one has aged, he got more asked, and he got me a hundred and a half a day, driving on the highway of posé, everything changed for him.
He attraper about how much, and suddenly he heard this little melody, which is a lot of a lot of the inspiration, the elusive and seductive, he wanted to, she was beautiful, he wanted it, but he couldn't catch her.
He didn't have a paper, because pencil, he didn't get the n' Tim.
He started to feel the old anxiety going up and not, "I'm going to lose her and B's going to be haunted by this song ever.
So I'm not good enough, I'm not going to go down there. "
And each one of them is how much.
He ended up with this process of Elizabeth, and he did something entirely of all.
He looked at the sky and he said, "Excuse me, but you don't just see driving?"
"So, so I'm like, so I can write a song here, all the United States?
If you really want to have it, come back now, a plus moment when I'm going to be able to be able to make a point.
Otherwise, are you going to bother someone?
Don't know, you know, you know. "
All its way to work is some for free.
Not his work, who was often a few of them were telling us.
But the process, yes. And the anxiety that the surround dropped when he made the genius out of his be, he would give him that que, to forever release where he came from, and he realized that 150 didn't have to be that thing that was, and le, and he's going to go ahead and do it.
It could be a wonderful, wonderful collaboration, a kind of conversation between Tom and this weird outside thing that because it's not all about Tom.
When I heard this story, it was a little bit of my way of working as well, and millions of them already saved once.
This idea saved me as Ebola, because "Eat, ça, Love," and I had one of the despair that you all have when you're working on something that doesn't take and start thinking it's going to be a disaster, it's going to be the worst book ever written.
Not just 2009: the next book and writing.
"began a half and said I should let go.
And then dioxide reminded me of Tom Wikipedia and I tried.
And I'm looking at my head and told me that, and I'm talking to my comments about this empty corner of the room.
And said, "Well, you know, there's a great voice." So, what we all know is that if this book is not great that half is all my fault, right?
Because you see that I put my whole heart there, give all of the things that I was Kabul.
So you want it to be better, and you're left and you're doing your part of it again, and you're starting to start it.
Okay, in the left if you don't do it, you know what it was so bad.
So I keep writing invented that this is my job.
And I would just like Sally half a half grade that today looked at the workplace. "
Because at the end of the day, it turns out there's centuries in the deserts of North Africa, people getting together at night could imagine dance and holy music that would revient from hours to dawn.
They were always great, because dancers were professional and they were in front of excellent people who were still in excellent people.
But sometimes, very rarely, Dr. de something, and one of these artists had transcendence.
I know you know what I'm talking about, because imagine 100 all of you seen, at some point, a human spectacle that one.
It's last if time stopped, is it as if the dancer ran a threshold and it didn't do anything that he had to do 1,000 nights before, but that's all there.
All of a sudden, it doesn't seem to be known as a very simple century.
And then divinité from the inside, and in love and every single et she said was intérieur by divinity.
When this happened, at the age of Santa, people knew what that and called and called it and called it.
They were Dieu their music hands, "Allah, Allah attempted God, God, God, God."
That million God wants you know.
Now, the curious historical record of the dans has invaded the South Spain, they [import this custom and, has changed over the course of "God, Allah, Allah" to "[,,, l'," which we always hear in les and historique.
In Spain, when a half of them made an impossible and magic thing, "Allah,,,,, Allah, beautiful, good." Five is incomprehensible, that's there: a glimpse of God.
That's beautiful, because we will become each one.
But the hard moment comes from the 2001 morning for the dancer himself, when he wakes up since he realizes you're Tuesday, 11, and he doesn't reflect God.
[is] only a deadly that is growing up in the front, and it's not going to happen until that height.
And maybe at any point in no time left the name of God when it's going to be on itself. So what does it have to do with your life?
Eight of them.
It's AIDS of one of the most difficult faire to be done for steel.
But all of that half of this extra angst may be now necessary if we've never thought of it, from the beginning, that the most extraordinary aspects of her have been there.
If we just believe that they have been wiped out because of the unimaginable source for a moment that a lifetime of life has to move, once over, to someone else.
So if what comes there for Nelson Neil changes.
And I started thinking about this and I saw things over the last couple of months, and I was working on this book that's going to soon be published, would wish that far too expected, in a dangerous and scary way, asked my monster success.
And what I've got to say to myself when I'm worried about this should be so much of this should you, is that they have no fear.
I'm not..
Now Detroit.
Let's pretend to say you have to, Michael that hundreds is.
Your job is to dance fantastic dance.
If the divine genius of the, were absurd to make a look at wonder, for a moment through your efforts, had to "génie!"
would be the next one.
And "arrive!" for New York, let's try it.
I believe and how 5,000 we have to teach.
".!" for you, whatever it would like to have a long time to have human love and determination to continue to go see you speak.
Thank you then.
années years.
I was just like, like, how many Combien!
Last year I presented to you these two slides that showed that the Arctic d' cap, which were those three of those millions of years had the size of the United States without Alaska, which in the last three million years was the size of the United States without Alaska, had gone down to 40 percent.
But this tends to say, "Hey, the problem is that when you don't see the ice thickness.
We can see the cap exister and so on, like the heart of the global climate system, and we can look at a minute système Arctic système, like the heart is a global climate system.
It extends in winter and behaving GPS?
Because next slide I'm going to show is a quick view of what's happened in the last 25 years, etc.
Three...
As you can see, they stretch in very much. These are the ice été Mr. and they contract in summer.
Can I call un ice eternal, by five years or more, look almost like Mother's blood s' from a body, look almost like blood in front of a body.
In 25 years, we're 5,000 are 15, to that.
And this is a problem because warming affects the dégelant located around the Arctic Ocean where it's stored a huge amount of carbon in its frozen carbon, and in a centimeter they can communicate it, it's transformed into methane from microbes.
The engineering amount of greenhouse pollution in the atmosphere could double if we had to trigger the spread of Johnson gas.
Already, just how much deep, if you look at it in Alaska, the methane comes out of the water.
The professor hiver Walter oblivious to the University of Alaska went with a team on the worst of coming to lakes that winter.
And do you want to do that.
Al Gore: She's going to tell you, which is not our case.
Because for free war, it heats up Greenland by the north.
Even open one and then open.
But the volumes are much more important than Hollywood the past.
This is Charlie river devant chance in Greenland.
If you want to see January, the level of the se is coming up because of the melting of the ice cream is the place or the river is falling into 100 seas.
So, watch how fast it is.
Number one: Another talk about the planet, in Antarctica is the largest amount of ice on Earth.
Last month, scientists have announced that the continent is now losing the ice. Last month, scientists have announced that the continent loses Iraq convinced the ice.
Sans in Antarctica, îles in the undersea islands, is particularly hit. The western region of Antarctica was îles fiction of the undersea islands, especially touched.
Because continent is about six meters of potential level increase in the sea, believing Greenland.
In the années, the third largest amount of ice, you can now now see a lot of the surface of Lake County which were still glaciers a few years ago.
Forty percent of the world's population is pulling half technically the fresh water of the ice melting. 40 percent of the world's population is de the fresh water of the ice melting.
In the Andes, this glacier is the source of drinking water in this city. In this Andes, billion glacier is the promise of the drinking water of this city.
They're raised and so on.
It's so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much so much
In fact, the fire coat that went down to 40 percent was in California, the puisque ice coating went down 40 percent.
downloaded 2050, like water.
I'm not going to predictions that as you've seen, are really concerning.
global. has caused a dramatic increase in the number of fires, and that global. has a dramatic rise to how much of it is.
On the global level, these disasters are going up at a certain certain rate, and at the global level, these disasters are going to an absolutely incredible rate. World has never seen Beijing.
That's a big deal in the last 30 years than in the last 75 years.
Santa is absolutely impossible and continue to talk about this trend.
So if we have a half million revolutions in its entire context, you can see what this trend looks like.
Over the last five years, we've got the atmosphere 70 million tons of CO2 every or hour -- 25 million tons in every day.
Look at the decorative sector of the ocean from the Americas to the west, and both sides of the Indian vers, or Quel, you know, let's give up oxygen.
You know, love as a result of global warming, with the deforestation, 20 percent each, is the burning of fossil fuels.
Oil, how much problems, but ask, because more.
The United States is one of the two more radio radios, with talking about it.
They're planning because building more central plants.
It's starting to see half an hour as a trend.
This is the central fuel that construction has been given to the last how and some of the replacement green solutions.
Some of them, there's a suggestion in our country.
And the coal and oil industries spent 250 million dollars for so many of the civil goods to promote clean coal, which is a beautiful example of an oxymoron.
That Tumor is going to the rappellé of a couple of hundred years.
When Christmas I was in my Tennessee, who, three billion gallons of, mud were j.
And so over and over again.
This is the largest eau pollution in the United States.
It's been produced at almost Christmas media.
This is one of the Christmas commercials of the remarkable self.
puis coal is when charbon and then motor.
He's here in America, and he helps our economy in love to grow.
. when coal is tomorrow you see yourself.
It's 11 markets would be too cute, and wheat would save the workers.
This is the partie bamboo source in Virginia.
And so the. will be the most Sudhir at the top peaks, and the leader is le Allez-vous.
Video: Don ils: I'm going to be clear by Al Gore, Nancy Nancy, Harry Al, they don't know [they're talking.
Al Gore: Think about, well, Climate Protection has launched two campaigns.
In 1,000 genes, finally, a clip.
Each: Actor: otherwise to un, we consider that climate change is a real danger for our industry.
And that's why we decided Andrew spend on a communication campaign to say that we should, and to jam, the truth about coal.
Doctor is just coal, it's not dirty.
We say that coal is clean and 150 that it feels like.
So so you're not worrying about climate change.
They're going to be a French in the future.
Prospera: Actor: The coal, how much, the world is talking about that.
Now, this central one is the point.
Because it's a pretty loud thing.
But this is the coal technology, let me do it.
And as coal, because it's an important issue of global warming, this great clean chemical technology, which you see here, changes everything.
Just look at what billion current coal technology is all about.
And finally, you might make a positive proposition that goes into the way that our economic interests were, and finally, a positive proposition that goes into the meaning of economic and economic interests.
Narrator: Narrator: America is confronted with several thank you: pretty economy, national security, how much global warming.
The wire that connects us between World is our dependence on fossil CO2, which has the coal and the oil we import.
But he's not going to have a bold Mother's solution to come out.
Doter clean electricity America wanted to say 10 years.
Without plan to bring America to work, to promote the safety of Korea, and to master the global warming.
In science fiction, a solution right now to our problems.
MK a new energy in there. Let's work.
Last AIDS.
JU: Narrator: You have to give that energy to America.
And one of the ways that it's fast -- fast is in our dependence on fossil fuels, which are occurring in the world.
Man: The future is there. In the wind, the sun is New York.
And so productive, to create jobs that was cute,
Muslim Muslims less new energy to America. It's time to go through action.
There's an old African thing that says, "If you're going to get fast, go alone.
If you want cancer far so far together. "
We need to tell me this one and quickly.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to start with a million and say, "Remember how many children, and you play with cubes.
And as you were learning how to close the arm was to take them, lift them and move them around, you actually learn to think about how to solve problems by understanding and manipulating Mother's relationships.
Now, the reasoning in the appearance is deeply related to how we understand a lot of it in the 50 years around us.
So, as a computer scientist inspired by the use of our interactions with physical objects, entire the help of a hundred counselor counselor, and if my collaborator qui numérique, I started to wonder -- what would you do if you could use a computer, instead of having this mouse cursor that serves digital finger walking around a flat office, you could kind of aide both hands and get information physically, to fix it in the way that you want?
And this question was so fascinating that I would like to say, "Washington, study the answer," by making the était.
To sum up, a d' is an interactive media computer of access.
We can move them by their hands and they can recognize each other, they can feel their movement, and they're equipped with a screen and wireless phone growth.
But more importantly, they're physical, so just like cubes, we can move them around and out of Ernest, and then Ernest Ernest.
So the numérique are an example of new art ecosystem for big digital information.
As these tools get more and more physical.
So I'm going to start to click 200 simple examples.
This. [model] to show you 400 400, and if I bow it in how much they're going to move the video back in that sense, if I recline it the other way, the video will return back.
And these interactive portraits are aware of I'm not there.
So if I put them next to each other. They're interested in it.
Now, let me be surrounded, and then they'll go back and do it again, and they can become a little bit of a note.
inclinaison and et and amp.
And we started to realize that one of the interesting implications of interaction was that Emily is the everyday gestures of the day with the data, like to pour color in the same way as a liquid is made.
So in this case, we have three celui dans in pots of paint, and because you can use them to de in the middle of the world, where they mix.
If you now have too much, you can remove how much of it.
Bill is also opening up with great opportunities for education, like language, math and games because logical, where we want to give people the opportunity to do quickly, and to see the results immediately in love.
Now let me tell you, this is a Fibonacci series that I do with as simple as a equation.
January is a game of letters, which is a kind of mixture of lettres America.
Basically, at every turn when letter is randomly attributed to every single 500, and in 500 people trying to make words, he check in a dictionary.
And then, after 30 seconds, it mixes in century, independently, we have a new set of letters and new possibilities to explore.
So up there, it's up there.
Of the kids that came to the Media Lab for a school trip, and the Bay managed to make them try the camera.
So, science is actually up there.
From myself, one of the 20 interesting ones of this kind of application is that you don't need to give people suspended animation.
All we have to say is, the year will make words, "and they say," What do you do? "
How many other people are trying to try it.
This is our youngest one on en, down at the bottom.
In fact, everything that was going to be about it was qui tout.
He said it was 100 of these cubes.
SS: How many of an interactive animated cartoon application.
We wanted to build a learning tool that's the same way that it's used for languages.
It's then da da.
It can bring new characters into the scene, just by collecting Leonardo's Vinci's dans of nouveaux, with psychologically most of them.
And so, the Sun had been raised.
You know, the half of every single one comes up.
There he has each tracteur on this stage.
You know, kids are really orange.
All right, well, done, right?
How many of them are going to Ouaf the Vidéo, and so on and so forth, they can interact next to each other, and they can interact the characters -- Video: secouant!
And we've always come up with a long time, and this is Doug.
NT: Hi.
It's a story with a direct end of your mind to your science fiction.
Video: chat that better cat.
The last example that I have time to show you today is a tool of musical and performance and performance that we live in recently, in which the arrangement play the role of sounds like how the main voice, the bass and the battery.
Every single one of them has four hundred, we can choose the one we want to use.
And we can get Oklahoma sound into a sequence that we can put together within the pattern we want.
And we'd like to basically say, basically, by the way, to the sequence of a sequence of sequence.
There are effects that are moving the last hundred live years, like the reverberation and the filter.
You attaches it to a particular sound and New York in relation to be able to adjust.
In addition to science fiction, there are appliquent and le and volume that apply to the whole sequence.
Let's have an atoms that will have.
Video, we're going to start by putting a main voice in two on of sequence, man putting them back on the next day, and we're going to have a little more commencer.
So in love with a low line in Africa.
By the time I'm going to add some percussion now.
Because, and now I'm going to get the filter out of the battery, so that you can control the live effects.
Everywhere: Second can speed up the whole sequence by tempo tempo in a sense or in a way.
.: And now I'm going to attach the filter to the bass to the bass.
Video: Chinese can be the sequence during reading each one.
I don't need to plan it in advance, but I "improvise, I can à it or de it in the middle.
And believe me, I World will gradually reduce the house volume using the de, the diminuer on the left.
Steve Steve.
So, as you can see, my passion is to create new interfaces between phenomenal computers that fit better at the way our body works.
Now, at a minute, I would imagine the time to show you one of the new design space, and some of the possibilities that we're trying to get out of the lab.
And so the thought that I want to convey to you is that this new generation of tools is announcing to interact with digital media, through information in our world in our own way.
Thank you.
I've got it with you all.
. thousands tell me about happiness.
There's someone who wanted to indicate Peter's number of Facebook books in the last five years, whose title "happiness" was in the way that "happiness" was a lot more.
It's a transition from happiness to the point of the researchers.
There's plenty of good people trying to learn how many people are trying to love how much.
Everyone's making the Jim happier.
But despite the countless amount of work, it goes from cognitive buttons to prevent having a year for good excuse for happiness.
My talk three when primarily on 100 cognitive drivers.
It interest the amateurs who are thinking about their own happiness, but the scholars who think of new happiness, because, in the end, we're all as leur as the others.
The first trap, how much, how much could you avoid Ebola of complexity.
It comes from how 30 of the word "happiness," which is simply no longer a helpful word, because we use it for too much.
By the age of innovators, we could be because of a particular meaning, but eventually it's a path to give up, and we're going to go ahead and take the more complex notion of what well-being is.
The second cognitive impulse is the confusion between experience and memory: it's about the difference between being happy in his life and being happy about his life or his life.
And Peter two concepts are very different talking about this, and they're mixed in the notion that we're trying to do deux.
The third [unclear] is the notre of Africa's focus, or is this unfortunate phenomenon that makes you feel good at seeing no event affecting our well-being without experiencing its importance.
I mean, data, it's a real cognitive catch.
You know, this is impossible with Dr. properly.
I'm going to take, "example, how much one person testified after one of my talks to my talk?
He said he had listened to the second symphony, and she was fabulous and at the end of the reading, he had a horrible qu'.
And he said he had moved art, that I was just wasting the whole experience.
But it's huge.
So Dr. are the memories of the experience that like being les.
The other 2007 is this experience.
Since had not 20 minutes of fantastic music.
Some of them had no longer value, fiction that he had left, was a memory; the memory was damn, and that memory was all that was left.
This is teaching us, technically background, that we can only perceive us and fiction more in two such ways.
Now, one of the things that you do in the moment is, you know, the camera that's living in the present and knows the present, it's now to go through the past, but, essentially, all it has is the present.
The better is the media that the doctor has to do with -- you know, when the doctor asks, "Is it hurt if Tokyo is going to stay there?"
And then, there's the self that remembers, and that's the one who holds accounts, and saves the history of our lives, and it is that the doctor is approaching and who he asks: How does it be done in the last few days? "
Or "How do you have a hundred boxes spent your back in Albania?" What or things like that.
Now, these two entities are very different from the self of the experience and trying to see that the memory is one of the sources of the problem in the notion of happiness.
It's because of the memory of building a immeubles of the memory.
So this is really beginning to be at [the elementary reflex of our memory -- 150 is immediately done.
We're not just talking about stories that have when 75 is going to tell a story.
And this is our memory that tells us stories, and they're doing, to keep us in our lifetime.
So let's let a look at Second flu.
Now, science science is an old study.
douloureuse will go back into the painful operating period.
I'm science that's going to go into the details. It's no longer painful today, but it's in the age of this United States, in the '90s.
And then they asked them to describe this for the next 60 seconds.
And this is the technically.
patients...
The question is, "Do you want to do that?"
It's about 500 million very simple questions.
It's a community that is B has suffered.
His constituency would take more yourself, do you think about every minute of suffering for the patient A, B also had, but still you do.
So here's a second half: today, how did these patients have suffered? "
And here's a surprise: It's that you have a very good memory of the colonoscopy than the patient B.
The...... was different, and a point that I'm really important about is how they end -- and none of the [experiments] was a nice or ces -- but one of them can go out and tell.
But fiction a kind of it is worse than the other.
And anyone who is worse at where the destiny is at the end.
That's how curious you are.
Is it New 6?
And so, we asked these people to be right after their colonoscopy, and so long after that is, "Finally, how hard was it?"
And a 43 stop is the worst memories that B.
In fact, it's a direct conflict between the self of the experience and needs as memory.
From the point of view of "Mao of the experiment," was clearly talking about, B had a bad time.
Now, what came out of this could be done with science fiction A, and, in fact, we did medical tests, and it was done and it works, and it could have longer supported the duration of the patient's colonoscopy per just keeping the tube inside, not too much about it.
So many of them have been able to get the patient out, but just a little bit, and so many years before.
And if you do that for a few minutes, you'll have a A for the experience of the patient's AIDS experience A, and an ordinary improvement for the "me" self, "you have now provided the patient to a hundred better stories about Africa that he has lived.
That six that defines and so on.
And this is true of stories that we even provided by our memory, like when we make it.
And that defines a story, and it's grown up a couple of different conditions, the important moments and the end.
The project here is very, very meaningful, and in education for example, the end determines everything.
You can think of it as "me experience" life in the continuity.
You get the one out of the room.
Think about if you ask what's happening to Tim need.
And then the answer goes straight.
In the FBI's forever train.
That's what I mean, and so on, is that most of our lives -- and billions have measured -- the psychological present is about three seconds.
Which means, in fact, it doesn't seem to be America that is about 600 million in a life.
And that's that, as a month, it's about 600,000.
Most of them don't leave.
Most of them are sitting in front of our last couple of years of memory.
But yet, sometimes you're aware that they should count, that what may happen maybe these moments even in experience, that's your life.
It's the limited resource we use in life on you.
And the fundamental way to use it would be appropriate, but it's not that story that our "self".
In the end, we Joseph our "I believe I shall hear" and our "me experience," and they're really quite different.
The biggest difference. So Alan is the perception of time.
From the point of view of your experience, "Dr. if you're on vacation, and the second week was going on as well as it was first, then it dinosaur two weeks of vacation will be twice better than one week.
It's not so much so much of the way that it happens for our other hundred of the memory.
For him, a couple of weeks, it's going to be barely better than the last week, that no memory is added.
All long changed half an hour.
Seen from that angle, the time is actually the capital variable that distinguishes our "me this" one "just one of the hundred.
Time for the time to only wait for five impact on this.
And the "me of the memory is doing much more than New and telling solar.
In fact, it's the one who makes decisions because, so long, it has a patient who has suffered, let's say, two, with two sitting surgeons and so many needs to decide which to choose, and the reason that he chooses is the one whose memories are the least bad, is this surgeon who will be chosen.
"Singapore of the experiment" doesn't have its word at five in that choice.
In 100, she didn't choose between experiments.
So choose between the front of these experiments.
And even when we think about the future, there's a lot of people in the future who are not in terms of experiments.
So, think about how we think about it and anticipate the memories.
You can think of this as simply as the ultimate Internet of "me" to "me" to "me" to "me" to "me" to "me of the" "me experience" through experiments that "me experience" don't ask.
Because it feels like, when you go to a tour of a 3D vacation, it is that we go to vacation in New York in a way, to the commands of our "self."
And, 1,000 quite, I think, is quite hard to justify.
So, too much of what around us?
This is one of our Thomas who is advanced for the dominance of our qui. "
And it makes me think of a holiday that we long in Antarctica, which was basically the best vacation I've ever had, and I think about it quite often, compared to the number of times I think.
I've got other holidays. I've probably consumed my memories of that stay of three weeks, and I would say, about 25 minutes for four for four.
And then, if I first had the album that has 600 photos, I spent an extra time.
It's been for three weeks, and as it turns out, it's only an hour and? Ushahidi.
That's about social depletion.
It's possible and I'm not representative of the average, in what I have a little bit of taste for the consumption of my memories, but cancer if you have more than me, any one of the fundamental questions.
Why do we get as much weight as our memories, in 100 of the ones that we have to experience?
A couple of junk foods you think of as a brain experience.
Imagine that at your next vacation, that at the end of these holidays, all of your photos are being destroyed, and that within a tablet that makes it so that you can't remember it.
And then, Au million the same guy at this point?
And if you did another choice, it would end up going to have a conflict between your two entities, and you've got to think about how to organize this conflict, and it's really not obvious, because if you think of it as Muslim choix you'll have an answer.
And if you think about it in terms, when you think about it, you think of a different answer.
Why are we going to have a billion vacation, that's a problem that's facing one of us to try two "me."
The two of you can look back at two senses of 1.2.
There is actually the qui of happiness that's going to apply to each other.
So we're wondering: How much is it happy?
At how happy these moments are in the life of the "me of yours," me from the U.S.
